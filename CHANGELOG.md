### Technical Details

#### Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: NodeManager for centralized node management
- **Factory**: Player creation through Manager
- **Builder**: FilterBuilder for chainable API
- **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive event system

#### Lavalink v4 Compliance
- Update Player REST endpoint (`/v4/sessions/{sessionId}/players/{guildId}`)
- WebSocket path (`/v4/websocket`)
- Required headers (Authorization, User-Id, Client-Name, Resume-Key)
- All v4 filters supported
- Complete load result types (track, playlist, search, empty, error)
- Track encoding/decoding
- Session management with resumption

#### Load Balancing Algorithm
- Player count penalty
- Playing player count penalty (higher weight)
- CPU load penalty (normalized by core count)
- Memory usage penalty (threshold-based)
- Frame stats penalty (deficit and nulled frames)
- Pluggable for custom strategies

#### Fault Tolerance
- Exponential backoff: base delay × 2^attempt
- Random jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Configurable maximum attempts
- Automatic backoff reset on success
- Connection timeout handling
- Heartbeat monitoring (30s timeout)
- Graceful degradation

### Performance
- Efficient WebSocket connection handling
- Minimal REST API calls
- Position tracking optimization
- Connection pooling across nodes
- Lazy evaluation where appropriate
